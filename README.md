projectstructure
================

Whoooo!!! There is no magic inside.

Clone the repo to local.

All it gives is simple file structured to start your web project. 

Note: If you want a rich environment with sass compiler, live reload, etc., I would recommend YEOMAN or google web-starter-kit.

You may ask then why the hell do you have this repo. I get stupid ideas often and I want to kickstart them then-and-there before it goes off my head. To kickstart, I just want just a kicker and not a flying machine. So this bare stucture will help me kickstart with my ideas.

The folder structure is as follows:

projectstructure --root(change it according to your wish in your local)
|
|___assets
|	|
|	|___scripts
|	|	|
|	|	|___vendor
|	|	|	|
|	|	|	|__(all vendor scripts like jquery, velocity, etc,. goes here)
|	|	|
|	|	|___main.js
|	|
|	|___stylesheets	
|		|
|		|___vendor
|		|	|
|		|	|__normalize.css
|		|	|
|		|	|__(all vendor stylesheets bootstrap, zurb, etc,. goes here)
|		|
|		|___main.css
|	
|___index.html
|
|___license (Really important so you can remove it)
|
|___README.md (You are reading it. So rm README.md would do)


That's all. I am kicking-starting :)
